If you have glibc-2.3.1 then none of the software written by djb will
compile because of an incompatible declaration of errno.

Here you can find patches correcting this problem.

To use the patches
==================

From the top distribution directory, apply the appropriate errno patch
with -p1.  So, for example, for mess822, you would do

tar zxvf mess822-0.58.tar.gz
cd mess822-0.58
patch -p1 < /path/to/mess822-0.58.errno.patch

In case of daemontools, you need the following adjustment:

tar zxvf daemontools-0.76.tar.gz
cd admin/daemontools-0.76
patch -p1 /path/to/daemontools-0.76.errno.patch

Notes
-----

ucspi-tcp: 

	in addition to the errno patch, there is the a_record patch.
	It allows you to specify the error that will be returned
        for a zone that has only A records in it.

ucspi-tcp-0.88.nodefaultrbl.patch:

	This patch changes the behavior of rblsmtpd so that if  
	no `-r' flag is given, than instead of falling back to 
	rbl.maps.vix.com as the default RBL, rblsmtpd assumes 
	that no RBL is to be used.
